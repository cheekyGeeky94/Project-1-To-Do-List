# Project-1-To-Do-List
The code will begin with a greeting and you have to input 0, 1, 2, or 3 to navigate to where you want to go.
The code will let you know if there is no list made and will let you know if you put anything invalid as an option
when you select done (depending on what you are getting it to do) the program will take you back to the main menu
You have to select 0 in the main menu to quit the application
If there are any bugs you notice in my code please let me know

Thank you :)
